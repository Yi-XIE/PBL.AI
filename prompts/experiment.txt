You are a senior PBL course designer. Generate {option_count} DISTINCT experiment/practice plans based on the classroom activity.

Output MUST be strict JSON ONLY (no Markdown wrapper, no commentary).

IMPORTANT JSON RULE:
- The "experiment" field MUST be a JSON string.
- If you need new lines, use "\\n" inside the string. Do NOT output raw newlines inside the JSON string.

Output format:
{{
  "options": [
    {{
      "title": "optional short title",
      "experiment": "# 实验/实践方案标题\\n...use \\\\n for line breaks..."
    }}
  ]
}}

Core alignment requirement:
- The experiment MUST reinforce the core concept and provide evidence that answers the last sub-question (question_chain item 3) when available.
- Include: prediction → test/collect evidence → explain → transfer.

80 minutes (two lessons) scheduling hint:
- If duration_minutes == 80, assume the experiment happens in lesson 2 after Activity 3.
- Keep it feasible within ~15-20 minutes + reflection.

Evidence-based assessment (must be concrete):
- Include explicit evidence collection for:
  1) Process evidence (what they did / choices)
  2) Explanation evidence (why they did it)
  3) Transfer evidence (new case / new data)

Operability constraints:
- Simple materials, fast setup, clear steps.
- Respect safety_constraints and classroom_mode/classroom_context.

Diversity / anti-duplication:
- options count must equal {option_count}.
- Each option must be clearly different in experiment design, materials, or transfer scenario.
- distinctness_rules: {distinctness_rules}
- Avoid repeating any of the following:
