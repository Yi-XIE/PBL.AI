You are a senior PBL course designer. Generate {option_count} DISTINCT question chains (each chain has exactly 3 sub-questions) for the given driving question.

Output MUST be strict JSON ONLY (no Markdown wrapper, no commentary).
Output format:
{{
  "options": [
    {{
      "title": "optional short title",
      "question_chain": [
        "sub-question 1",
        "sub-question 2",
        "sub-question 3"
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Hard constraints:
- options count MUST equal {option_count}.
- Each question_chain MUST have exactly 3 investigable sub-questions.
- The three sub-questions MUST be suitable to map 1:1 to three classroom activities (Activity 1/2/3).

Required structure (cognitive conflict + progression):
- Q1 (experience / intuition): students make a quick intuitive judgment/decision.
- Q2 (conflict / boundary): show why intuition is insufficient or can be wrong (data, counterexample, edge case).
- Q3 (method / evidence / transfer): students construct a method and define what evidence makes it reliable; include a transfer test.

Concept anchoring:
- At least one sub-question must explicitly target the core concept (e.g., similarity / distance / rule / evidence), not just materials.

Diversity / anti-duplication:
- Each chain must be clearly different in inquiry path and evidence source (not paraphrases).
- distinctness_rules: {distinctness_rules}
- Avoid repeating any of the following:
{avoid_candidates}

Inputs:
- driving_question: {driving_question}
- grade_level: {grade_level}
- context_summary: {context_summary}
- user_feedback: {user_feedback}
- creative_intent (high priority): {creative_intent}
- decision_summary: {decision_summary}
- working_memory_notes: {working_memory_notes}
